// Datatypes in javascript
// undefined,null,boolean,string,symbol,number and object

// There are three ways to declare a variable in js
var a = "Anuj"; //when the variable has to be used in whole program
let b = "hulids"; //when variable is only being used in a scope where we declare that
const pi = 3.14; //value of the variable cannot be changed during the whole program
console.log(a);
// incrementing a varible same goes for decrementing
var num = 34;
console.log(num);
num++;
console.log(num);
num--;
console.log(num);
var str = 'this is a "Quote string" and this is outside the quoted string';
console.log(str);
// we can declare string by using "" or '' and ``
var str2 = 'This is single quote string""';
var str3 = `This is a backticks string''""`;
console.log(str2);
console.log(str3);
